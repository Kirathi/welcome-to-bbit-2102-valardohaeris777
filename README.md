## Part 1: Getting started with GitHub

We will be using GitHub Classroom for assignment distribution and turn-in. This will lead you getting started with GitHub and Git.

**If you are familiar with GitHub and have an account, [skip to Part 2](#part-2-get-the-a0-code).**

### Q: What is Git and GitHub?

*   **Git** is a [distributed version control system](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control), which is a program that developers use to track and manage changes to source code over time.
*   **GitHub** is a company that provides hosting for code that is managed by the Git version control system.

Git and GitHub are sophisticated tools for collaborative software development, used by millions of software developers worldwide. Git is incredibly powerful, but it has a somewhat notoriously steep learning curve.

Note however, for BBT 2102, we will only be using a very small subset of Git and GitHub’s features.

### 1\. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/)

_Skip this if you already have a GitHub account._

*   You will need a GitHub account to use GitHub Classroom.
* You **Must** use your @strathmore.edu email address which you enrolled to Google Classroom with for ease of integration
*   Sign up for one if you don’t have one already.

### 2\. Get the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

_Optional: This is useful in general, but not a must for BBIT 2102._

*   GitHub offers a bunch of free services for students, including free unlimited private GitHub repositories.
*   Learn more and sign up via the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

<section id="part-2-get-the-a0-code" class="part-2-get-the-a0-code">

## Part 2: Get the A0 code

In BBIT 2102, we will be using GitHub for the following purposes:

1.  You will download the assignment starter code from GitHub.
2.  You will upload your assignment solution code to GitHub.
3.  You will publish your web page(s) to the internet via GitHub Pages.

### 1\. Accept the A0 assignment

*   [Follow this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/zn-cCAKD), where A0 is stored on GitHub Classroom.
*  Authorize the OAuth Client to allow Github Classroom to link to your Github account.

  [![](images/OAuth_authorize.png)](images/OAuth_authorize.png)

*   Click the green “Accept this assignment” button.

  [![](images/accept_a0.png)](images/accept_a0.png)

*   Follow the link to your newly created assignment on the next screen.

  [![](images/final_page.png)](images/final_page.png)

### 2\. Download the A0 starter code

Technically, your newly created assignment is a “GitHub repository.”

*   This is a private repository, meaning only you (and I) can access it.
*   This is basically a private online folder where you will ultimately store your finished assignment files. Right now, though, it contains the starter code for the assignment.

At this point, you want to download the files in this repository.

> ### Git-speak for people who are very familiar with Git already:
>
> _(Please **ignore this box entirely** if you’ve never used git before.)_
>
> *   The “assignment” created for you through the GitHub Classroom UI is a private GitHub repository like any other private GitHub repo you would own.
> *   You can **clone**, **push**, and **pull** to this repository using the command-line or whatever UI you prefer.
> *   If you want to use git to manage your assignment (as opposed to the GitHub web UI), just **clone** your assignment repository and [skip to Part 3](#part-3-edit-the-a0-code).

To download the starter code via the GitHub UI:

*   In your assignment repository, click the green “Clone or download” button.

  [![](images/clone_download.png)](images/clone_download.png)
*   In the menu that pops up, click “Download ZIP”

  [![](images/download_zip.png)](images/download_zip.png)

### 3\. View the starter code in a browser

Note that **Chrome** is the recommended browser for the course, and I will be grading your assignments using the Chrome browser. Please either [install and use Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) for development, or at least make sure to test your assignments in Chrome before submitting them.

*   Unzip your downloaded zip file somewhere on your computer
*   Open “index.html” in Chrome or another browser of your choosing.
*   You should see something that looks like the following:

  [![](images/a0-look.png)](images/a0-look.png)

<section  id="part-3-edit-the-a0-code"  class="part-3-edit-the-a0-code">

## Part 3: Edit the A0 code

### 1\. Download and install Atom

_Optional: We will be using Atom in lecture, but you may use whatever text editor you’d like._

We recommend that you use the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) for BBIT 2102.

*   [Download and install Atom](https://atom.io/)

It is not very important for you to use Atom if you prefer a different text editor for BBIT 2102. However, I will not provide support for any other editor besides Atom.

### 2\. Fix the TODOs in `index.html` and `style.css`

*   In Atom (or your preferred text editor), open `index.html` ,`style.css` and fix the TODOs.
*   If you’d like, you can further style, decorate, or modify your page to your liking. This is not required, however.

<section id="part-4-upload-to-github" class="part-4-upload-to-github">

## Part 4: Upload to GitHub

Now that you’ve completed the assignment, you should upload your files back to your Assignment 0 repository.

> ### Git-speak for people who are very familiar with Git already:
>
> _(Please **ignore this box entirely** if you’ve never used git before.)_
>
> *   If you cloned your repository via git, just commit all changes and push them to the repository on GitHub.
> *   You can now [skip to Part 5](#part-5-publish-your-github-page).

*   Navigate to your Assignment 0 repository on GitHub.
*   Click the “Upload files” button.

  [![](images/upload_files.png)](images/upload_files.png)
*   On the next screen, select your `index.html`, `style.css`, and your image file for upload. Your screen should now look like the following:

  [![](images/upload_files_2.png)](images/upload_files_2.png)

*   Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the green “Commit changes” button. You don’t need to fill out any of the form.

  [![](images/upload_files_3.png)](images/upload_files_3.png)

*   You should be redirected to the main repository screen again. The existing files should be updated and your new files should be uploaded.

</section>

<section id="part-5-publish-your-github-page" class="part-5-publish-your-github-page">

## Part 5: Publish your GitHub Page

You will now publish your website as a GitHub page. This will make your website publicly accessible on the internet. (Please remember the Honor Code)

*   Navigate to your assignment 0 repository on GitHub. (You should already be on this page.)
*   Click the “Settings” button.

  [![](images/publishing_1.png)](images/publishing_1.png)
*   On the Settings page, scroll down near the bottom to the “GitHub Pages” section. Under “Source”, click the button that’s currently set to “None”…

  [![](images/publishing_2.png)](images/publishing_2.png)
*   … and change it to “master branch”:

  [![](images/publishing_3.png)](images/publishing_3.png)

*   The page will reload and you will be taken back to the top of the Settings screen.
*   Scroll back down to the “GitHub Pages” section, and you should now see a link to your published GitHub page.
[![](images/publishing_4.png)](images/publishing_4.png)

*   Click your link to verify it is working as expected.
*   Note that this is a publicly accessible link. You can send it to your friends if you want to show it off!

Note: You may notice that on the Settings page, there is an option to make the repository public. **Please do not do this**.
